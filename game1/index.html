<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Well, considering that this is very much a toy game, and there is only
so much that I can do without experience, I would say this game is very
original in terms of the integration of thematic elements. :P
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game uses the latest and greatest physics that I guarantee nobody
else has ever used before! (There's nothing really special going on
technically).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about how to use phaser and Javascript, as was the
main goal of creating this game. I still have a lot to learn, but this
game definitely gave me a decent foundation going forward.

I would say the hardest part of creating this game was learning how to
properly set up collisions, followed closely by figuring out how to get
the animation to work properly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blue/Silver Vase: <a href="https://www.rubylane.com/item/61838-150922x20twt3368/Cobalt-Blue-Silver-Deposit-Vase-Red?search=1">Urn</a></li>
<li>Animated Explosion: <a href="https://giphy.com/stickers/explosion-attention-6mGPx9QGBTyUg">Explosion</a></li>
<li>Glass Breaking Sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/cmusounddesign/sounds/84704/">Glass sound</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I didn't really borrow anything from any other Phaser game, I just had
a random idea and rolled with it. But since I built off of the template
I guess that is the game that most closely resembles mine?
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Don't break the vase.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
"Grandmother's ashes"
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating how to control the movement of an object,
and how it interacts with its surroundings.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
As you can probably tell, this is a super light-hearted game just for
fun. I intend for the players to be amused.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The only thing the character can do is move the mouse to have the urn
follow their cursor. The "objective" of this game is to not crash into
the walls. The longer the player "survives" the higher score they get.
High score is displayed at the top left, while current score is
displayed on the top right.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
If you navigate away from the page, the score will keep going up.
Return some time later, and crash. Boom. High score.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
I'm kind of running out of stuff to say about this game. It doesn't
really have story, setting, or premise.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target demographic is college-aged people who don't mind a little
bit of dark humor.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game can theoretically be played however long the player wishes,
but it is intended to be played only for a few minutes.
</li>
