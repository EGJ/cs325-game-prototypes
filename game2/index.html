<h2>Beware the chickens!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I'd say this game is original by the fact that I am saving a part of the state
for each of the objects, allowing for a kind of rewinding of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I didn't use any special technology; the only thing I used was the standard
arcade physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot more about phaser. I figured out how to use sprite groups, how
to do use keyboard input, how to use certain functions for audio, and I got
spritesheets down fairly well. The hardest part of making this prototype was
definitely getting tweens to work properly, then checking to see if movement was
valid (bounds checking), and then structuring the code to allow for back tracking.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I didn't really base my game off of anything else, so it doesn't really resemble
any other game.</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Avoid the chickens for as long as possible, backtrack if necessary.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
"Chicken"
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
Input: Direct, Keyboard
Randomness: A lot of randomness
Play Styles: Joker
Genres: Overhead
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating how using this different form of movement affects
gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This is a game made just for fun; it is not a serious game at all, it is very
much a toy game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player uses the arrow keys to move. Every time the player moves, each of the
enemies (chickens) will also take a turn to move. A counter is set in place to
keep track of the amount of turns that the player has not collided with an enemy.
If the player does collide with a chicken, their score is reset to zero. If,
when the player clicks the key, they return to the position they just came from,
the player will return to that spot, but the enemies will stay in place for that
turn, as a sort of relative "undo" action. The goal of this game is to avoid the
chickens for as long as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Because the player can temporarily halt the movement of the enemies, the player
may be able to use that "undo power" to avoid the enemy if they are in a bind.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game takes place inside a chicken coop with a bunch of angry chickens out
for your life! Try to avoid getting hit as long as possible. I feel like a setting
like this is fairly unique, as I can't think of any other game in such a setting.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target demographic is the early twenties and below range. I don't think many
other people would find such an unpolished game even vaguely entertaining.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The player can play as long as they wish, but it is expected that they only
play for a couple of minutes;
