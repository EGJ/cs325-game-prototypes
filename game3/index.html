<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I'd don't think I know of a game where you are judged on how well you
can "trace" and image, so I'd say that's a unique concept.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I created custom polygons for the sprite - to create a much more accurate
"hit-box" for use with phaser's P2 physics. Also, I have a cool progess bar :P
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The hardest part of creating this game by far was figuring out how I could check
the things I drew on the screen for collisions with the sprite. Following this,
the next most hard thing to figure out is how to properly draw on the screen in the
first place - it was just really, really bad.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Though I did not base my game off of another, when I was in the middle of creating
this game, I thought that the game I was creating seemed somewhat similar to games
such as Draw Something.<br>Some code was adapted from 
<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/p2-physics/load-polygon-1">https://phaser.io/examples/v2/p2-physics/load-polygon-1</a> and
<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/bitmapdata/copy-bitmapdata">https://phaser.io/examples/v2/bitmapdata/copy-bitmapdata</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Trace over the given sprite as accurately as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
"Talent Show"
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: direct, mouse
Randomness: deterministic
Play Styles: Artist
Genres: Casual
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is prototyping a potential way to incorporate drawing
on the game screen and using mouse input.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game is very simple, it is just meant to be a fun little
game you only play for a little while.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The entire game is played using the mouse. While the mouse is held
down, a square will be painted on the screen at the position of the cursor.
If that region is inside the image, the player's score goes up, otherwise
it doesn't. While the player is drawing, they lose ink. When the player runs
out of ink, the game ends and they are told how well they did. (If I had more
time, the images would between times, and each round would have a time limit).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best way to play this game is to take it slow. Depending on the image used,
it should not be hard to consistently get 100%.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a aspiring new artist that wants to show your skill to the world.
At this talent show, you hope to do just that.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This is meant to be a family-friendly game. If this game had more polish,
and "multiplayer" capabilities, I think this game would fit well with this
audience.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Each round of the game only takes a minute or so.
</li>
