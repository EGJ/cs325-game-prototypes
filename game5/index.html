<h2>Teapot Racer</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My Game is a racing game, which in and of itself isn't super unique,
but I don't think there are any phaser games out there that involve racing - 
at least I couldn't find any. Also, this game incorporates gyroscopic
motion for mobile devices.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I built the game for both mobile and desktop, using separate controls for each (gyroscope vs arrow keys),
I tailored the sprites to fit my exact needs (sometimes involving a significant amount of work (e.g. fitting the
original curved roads to match the straight ones in the tilemap)), and I created a custom tilemap.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
Honestly, I learned a lot from this prototype. I learned about how to create tilesheets and tilemaps
with tiled, I learned how to use gyroscopic controls, I've become very competent with P2 physics,
and above all, I learned how to better deal with all Phaser's idiosyncrasies that make creating games difficult.

The hardest parts of creating this game were: manipulating the curved road image so that it would align correctly in the tile map,
getting the created tilemap to work with phaser (e.g. apparently tiled supports images of different sizes, but Phaser does not),
and getting collision detection to work properly.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I guess any racing game? I didn't base my game off of any specific game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Race to the finish line.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
"Teapot"
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Indirect, Direct, Keyboard
Randomness: Deterministic
Play Styles: Competitor, Achiever
Genres: Racing, Overhead
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating how tilemaps can be effectively used, and how gyroscopic motion works.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have fun, but I also want the game to be somewhat challenging, so it feels more rewarding
(e.g. go fast, but risk crashing, or take it slow but finish later).
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player will use either the arrow keys (desktop), or gyroscope (mobile) to move the car.
Once the player desides to start, the timer will begin, and the player must try to navigate
the track, and make it to the end without going off-road.
Note: There are some small gaps at the end of the curved section of the track. This sometimes means the
game will think you left the track when you didn't. I would fix it, but I don't have enough time... Sorry :/
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I suspect that taking it slow the first few times to get the hang of the controls is the best strategy.
Then, once the player is familiar with the controls, it is only a matter of time and skill to become
really good at the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this game, you are a teapot trying to show your worth to all those who don't think you are worth anything.
Prove them wrong! Show them that you are the ultimate racer.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I think people in their mid-teens to early thirties would enjoy this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 5-15 minutes.
</li>
