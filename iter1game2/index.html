<h2>The Last Robin</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I reversed the normal game of shoot stuff in the air from the ground to
dodge stuff shot at you from the ground while in the air..
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The game itself wasn't terribly hard, but it did take some time just to figure out how everything
would be laid out and interact with each other. Also, standardizing the sprites and making the game
scaleable was an interesting endeavor.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I guess this game is sort of like missile defense
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Dodge the smoke clouds for as long as possible
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Direct, Mouse
Randomness: Deterministic
Play Styles: Joker
Genres: Side-View
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
How to come up with an idea... Making a game a week is hard.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game is very simple, it is just meant to be a fun little
game you only play for a little while.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player moves their mouse to control the robin. If the player is hit by a smoke
cloud, then they lose a life and the smoke clouds are cleared from the screen.
If the player loses all of their lives, the game ends. There is no true ending to this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
This isn't really a game of strategy, its more a game of reflexes and quick pathfinding.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world is overpolluted and you are a robin trying to survive, though your struggle is futile.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I think anyone in their early to late teens would like this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes.
</li>
