<h2>Defend The Castle!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a tower-defense game without a set map.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Pathfinding: Enemies will always take the shortest path to the exit. Also, players are unable to block the way out.
Difficulty Scaling: The game continually gets harder the longer you play.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
From creating this game, I learned enough about Phaser that I feel comfortable creating a wide variety of other games using Phaser.
I do still need to tweak a few things regarding the difficulty of the game though.

The hardest part of creating this game was getting everything to interact with each other in the correct way,
and making the game scaleable (Changing the number of tiles in the board, enemy stats, difficulty increase, etc.) - 
Now, all of this is as easy as changing a few variables).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Everything was created from scratch except the following:
<ul>
<li>Cave: <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/creepypastaitalia/images/5/5c/Dark_Cave-Day.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/255?cb=20120704145252&path-prefix=it">Cave</a></li>
<li>Heart: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/54676056/">Heart</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game built upon my previous iteration. Things that were added: pathfinding, another tower, enemy health bars,
tower costs, customizable stats, walls, difficulty scaling, and some other stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Defend your castle from an unending onslaught of enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A (Optional).
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Direct, Mouse, Buttons
Randomness: Deterministic and A Lot Of Randomness
Play Styles: Achiever, Craftsman
Genres: Tower-Defense
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To push the boundaries of what I am able to create in a short period of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to be challenged, but still have fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player clicks the buttons on the bottom of the screen to select the object they would like to use.
They then click on the board to use the object. The towers and walls cost money to use, while the sell object
removes towers and walls from the board and refunds money to the player.
Enemies will constantly spawn from the cave and move towards the exit. If they reach the exit, one of the player's
lives is lost. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.
Towers will autmatically attack enemies based on their damage, range, and speed.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Making paths for the enemies to follow, and using different towers at strategic locations.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are the king of a town and must defend your castle. Due to a meteor impact, a cave was surfaced. You must now
do your best to protect your castle for as long as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I believe people in their late teens to early thirties would enjoy playing this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depending on how good the player is, this game can last anywhere from a minute to half an hour, perhaps.
</li>
